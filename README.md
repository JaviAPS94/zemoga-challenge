### Requirement before run

- This project has frontend project. You can access in this link: https://github.com/JaviAPS94/zemoga-challenge-frontend
- Run the frontend with the guidelines given in the Readme.

### How to run?

1. Clone the backend repository
2. In root directory run `docker build -t zemoga-challenge .`
3. Run `docker run -dp 8080:8080 -e DB_HOST=host -e DB_PORT=3306 -e DB_NAME=schem -e DB_USER=user -e DB_PASSWORD=password -e TOKEN=Bearer\ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPNkCAEAAAAAmcfv%2BXE59uvAZ6pzjUv%2Fu68sBHI%3DpujwAAAwLsqbNQivymaOn0NveuOmKcRItDb5TUpn8fXY3iUMs6 zemoga-backend`

Notes: 
- Env variables DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD and TOKEN are required.
- Variables DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD are in the requirements document provided by Zemoga (I do not put them in the repository because I consider them confidential)
- For DB_NAME variable use schema public. I have not used the one provided by you since I have considered that it was dirty and would cause an impact on development.
- For TOKEN variable use: Bearer\ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPNkCAEAAAAAmcfv%2BXE59uvAZ6pzjUv%2Fu68sBHI%3DpujwAAAwLsqbNQivymaOn0NveuOmKcRItDb5TUpn8fXY3iUMs6 or get token with zemoga credentials with the endpoint https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/token?grant_type=client_credentials
